# Sports Management System - Setup and Usage Guide

## üèà Quick Start Guide for Graders

This Sports Management System is a full-stack application with Flask backend and React frontend, connected to a publicly accessible PostgreSQL database via ngrok tunneling.

### üìã Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+** (for backend)
- **Node.js 16+** (for frontend) 
- **Git** (to clone repository)
- **curl** (for API testing)
- **jq** (for JSON parsing in curl examples)

### üöÄ Getting Started

#### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd TermProject
```

#### 2. Start the Backend (Terminal 1)
```bash
cd Backend
```

Activate virtual environment and install dependencies:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Start the Flask server:
```bash
python run.py
```

The backend will start on http://127.0.0.1:5000

#### 3. Start the Frontend (Terminal 2)
```bash
cd Frontend
npm install
npm start
```

The frontend will start on http://localhost:3000

#### 4. Access the Application
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- **Backend API**: http://127.0.0.1:5000

**Login Credentials:**
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin123`

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Connection

The system is configured to connect to a remote PostgreSQL database (sportsdb2) via ngrok tunneling. The database is already populated with sample data and publicly accessible for grading purposes. No additional database setup is required.

## üìä Adding Data to Database via API

### Authentication Setup

First, open a terminal, navigate to the Backend directory, ensure your virtual environment is active, and get an authentication token:

```bash
cd Backend
source venv/bin/activate
export TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"admin","password":"admin123"}' \
  | jq -r .access_token)
```

### Adding New Teams

Add teams that are not already in the database:

```bash
# Add Los Angeles Rams (NFL)
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/teams \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Los Angeles Rams",

# List all players
curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/players

# List all games
curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/games

# Get analytics data
curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/analytics/overview
```
