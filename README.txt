What's New?
Our Sports Management System (SMS) is designed to make managing sports
data easier and more effective. Instead of just keeping basic records, this
system will offer real-time insights, helping coaches and team managers make
smarter decisions. We will utilize Java for the backend and PostgreSQL for
storing all the data, providing a system that tracks player performance,
team results, and other key stats. What will make this system unique is the
ability to run complex queries and provide quick answers to important
questions, such as who the top-performing players are or how teams have
done over time. This system will help users keep tabs on match results,
player stats, and team performance in real-time.

Brief Description:
The Sports Management System will help users like team managers, coaches,
and sports analysts store and manage all kinds of sports-related data. Users
will be able to create teams, schedule matches, track player stats, and
analyze match results. We'll also build in support for running deeper queries,
such as ranking players by their performance over time, checking out a team's
win-loss record, or even tracking player injuries. Java will handle the backend
processing, and PostgreSQL will serve as the database to store all the data.
The system will be designed to handle multiple sports, such as football,
basketball, and tennis, and will allow users to view detailed reports and
trends over time. The goal is to provide a user-friendly platform that helps
teams and managers make better decisions based on data.

Sample Analytical Queries:

Top Players: Show the top 10 players based on their stats (goals,
assists, minutes played, etc.).
Win-Loss Ratios: Break down each team's win-loss record, showing how
they perform at home vs. away games over multiple seasons.
Injury Impact: Track how injuries affect team performance by showing
the average time players spend recovering and how their absence impacts
results.
Match Attendance Trends: Identify the matches with the largest
attendance and predict future crowd sizes based on historical data.
Team Efficiency: Rank teams based on how efficiently they score points
compared to their opponents in different sports.
Preliminary EER Diagram:
Our preliminary Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram will EXCLUDE the following
entities:

Players: Each player will have a unique ID, name, position, and stats
like goals and assists.
Teams: Teams will have details like their name, the league they belong
to, and their roster of players.
Matches: This will track details like the teams involved, match date,
score, and location.
Leagues: This will organize teams, with details like the league name
and which teams are part of it.
The relationships between these entities will allow us to show how players
belong to teams, teams participate in matches, and how leagues organize teams
and games.

Database Access (JDBC, Ebeans, Hibernate):
We will use JDBC, Ebeans, or Hibernate for database access.
