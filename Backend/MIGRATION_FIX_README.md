# Migration Fix Applied

## Issue Resolution

The migration error "Can't locate revision identified by 'e73522c41890'" has been resolved.

## What was the problem?

The database existed but was not properly initialized with alembic version tracking. This caused alembic to look for a non-existent revision ID.

## What was fixed?

1. **Stamped the database** with the initial schema revision (2d8789250ec8)
2. **Upgraded to the latest revision** (b5ce6cdd13d5) which includes all the comprehensive football statistics

## Current State

- ✅ Database is now at revision: `b5ce6cdd13d5` (head)
- ✅ All comprehensive football statistics fields have been added
- ✅ Migration system is properly initialized

## Future Migrations

You can now run normal Flask-Migrate commands:
- `flask db migrate -m "description"` - Generate new migrations
- `flask db upgrade` - Apply pending migrations
- `flask db current` - Check current revision
- `flask db history` - View migration history

The migration system is now properly set up and should work without issues.
